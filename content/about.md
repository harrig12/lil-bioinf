title: About the workshop

This is a introductory-level R workshop designed to give a brief overview of the R language, and some small bioinformatics tasks that function as stand-alone examples of the skills that a budding bioinformaticist should have in their toolbox.
The workshop was designed by [Gabriella Morgenshtern]() and [Cait Harrigan](), with reference to [learning units](http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/assets/ABC-units_map.svg) developed by [Dr. Boris Steipe](http://biochemistry.utoronto.ca/person/boris-steipe/). It runs in about 1 hour, although we also deliver a version that includes basics of statistical modelling in R, which runs in 2 hours. 

If you are attending the workshop: please *come prepared*. Download and install the following required software ahead of time. 
- [R language](http://cran.utstat.utoronto.ca/)
- [R studio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)

The workshop is constructed to feature 3 milestones:
1. Introduction to R skills
2. Data cleaning and exploration
3. Data visualization and data-driven biological reasoning

We encourage the practice of **pair programming**
