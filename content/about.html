<p>This is a introductory-level R workshop designed to give a brief overview of the R language, and some small bioinformatics tasks that function as stand-alone examples of the skills that a budding bioinformaticist should have in their toolbox.
The workshop was designed by <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4762-8797">Gabriella Morgenshtern</a> and <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9243-9648">Cait Harrigan</a>, with reference to <a href="http://steipe.biochemistry.utoronto.ca/abc/assets/ABC-units_map.svg">learning units</a> developed by <a href="http://biochemistry.utoronto.ca/person/boris-steipe/">Dr. Boris Steipe</a>. It runs in about 1 hour, although we also deliver a version that includes basics of statistical modelling in R, which runs in 2 hours.</p>
