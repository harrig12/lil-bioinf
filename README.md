# 1 About:

## 1.1 Overview
This repo holds scripts that accompany our R workshop for bioinformatics (and more!). This workshop is intended for first time R users, especially those interested in using R for bioinformatics. Previous programming experience is not necessary. 
&nbsp;

## 1.2 Requirements

You will need to download and install on your system:

- [R language](http://cran.utstat.utoronto.ca/)

- [R studio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)

# 2 Workshop information
We offer this workshop for free, upon request (and subject to our personal availability) because we love bioinformatics.

It works best for 10-20 attendees, however up to 50 can be accomodated if there are volunteers available to help run it.

The workshop runs in 1 hour, but can be modified to run in 2 upon request. For the 2 hour version, we will also cover some basics of statistical modelling in R. 

## 2.1 Request a workshop
To request a workshop, please send an email, and CC both organizers.
